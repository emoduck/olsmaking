# docs/adr

This directory stores Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Use ADRs for major technical decisions, especially:

1. Dependency additions with long-term impact.
2. Architecture boundary changes (frontend/backend/API/hosting).
3. New infrastructure or deployment patterns.

Create ADRs from `docs/adr/_template.md` and keep status current (`Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded`).
