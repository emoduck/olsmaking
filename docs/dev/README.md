# docs/dev

This directory is the source of truth for planned and in-progress features.

Use `docs/dev/_template.md` when drafting a new feature document.
Use `docs/dev/bootstrapper-command-catalog.md` for manager/bootstrapper execution flow.

Guidelines:

1. Create or update the feature doc during planning, before or alongside implementation.
2. Keep scope explicit (in/out) to avoid hidden behavior changes.
3. Track open questions and assumptions so implementation tasks stay actionable.
4. Update the doc when scope or behavior materially changes.
