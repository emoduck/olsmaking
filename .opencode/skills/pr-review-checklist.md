# Skill: pr-review-checklist

## Purpose

## Checklist

- Safety: no hidden security/cost/production-risking behavior.
- Validation: tests/build checks are present and meaningful.
- Documentation: `docs/dev` feature doc exists/updated when required.
- Scope: avoids unrelated refactors and dependency creep.

## Output Requirements
- Prioritize issues by impact.
- Include actionable fixes, not only problem statements.
